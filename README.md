- Loose coupling -> depend on abstractions/interfaces/contracts and not the concrete implementation. This means we have the freedom to switch out implementations.
- Reusability -> dependency injection allows us to inject what is required but specific modules or classes
- Flexibility -> less of a need to meddle with core business layers -> we can modify existing injected services (or create new ones)
- Explicit type safety -> you will know when things aren't correctly setup
